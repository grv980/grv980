 tail test.txt
 hello+
  
5]What are the different commands to copy a file from one location to another, give with example?

 Answer - free -m
 
 
7] "Unix stands for UNiplexed Information and Computing Service, Unix is written in C"

Use the above string to append it to a file ( say sample.txt) 10 times & then print the number of occurrences of "Unix word" in that file.

Note: Append operation of above string for 10 times should happen in one go. (do not repeatedly execute the same command)
Output should only display number of occurrences of Unix
Entire question should be executed as a part of single execution of command(s)

Answer - savera@savera:~/Desktop$ echo UnixstandsforUNiplexedInformationandComputingService,UnixiswritteninC$wojek{1..10}>>test2.txt | wc -w "unix" test2.txt
wc: unix: No such file or directory
 10 test2.txt
 10 total

8]Create below directory structure in a single execution of command

p0
├── p1
│   └── p2
│       ├── p3
│       │   └── p5
│       │       └── p9
│       └── p4
│           └── p5
│               └── p9
└── p6
    ├── p7
    │   └── p9
    └── p8
        └── p9
       Answer - mkdir -p p0/p1/p2{p3,p5,p9}/p2{p4,p5,p9}/p6{p7,p9}/p6{p8,p9}

       
       
9] Copy the file used in Question#7 (i.e. sample.txt) to p9 directory(s) of Question#8
As there are multiple p9 directories so sample.txt should exist inside all those p9 directories.
Write command for above question where copy operation should take place in single execution of command.
Verify your output using tree p0 command      
       
       Answer - cp sample.txt Desktop p9 
       
       
       
10] You have to correct the string mentioned in Question#7 in all the files where it exists
We want to replace "stands" word in the string to "abbreviates"
Note: This change should happen in all the files representing sample.txt in single execution of command.
       
       Answer - sed 's/stands/abbreviates/g' sample.txt
